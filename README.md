# image-classification

This project uses a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify images into the top 3 categories from the ImageNet dataset. The model is wrapped in a Gradio interface, making it easy to use and interact with. Simply upload an image, and the model will return the top 3 predicted labels along with their confidence scores.

# Features

Pre-trained Model: Utilizes MobileNetV2, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset.
Gradio Interface: Provides a user-friendly web interface for image classification.
Real-time Predictions: Upload an image and get instant predictions with confidence scores.
Top 3 Predictions: Displays the top 3 categories the model predicts for the uploaded image.
